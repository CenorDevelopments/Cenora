# Cenora
Original description will start after this announcement.
First thing is that we will have to delay Cenora 25.05 to another month due to it not being ready,
Also you will find messy code when we make it open-source. Note that this was never gonna go open source or anything but i 
decided to for people to customise it to their liking, a lot of the code is not connected and stuff so expect that.
in the later releases we will clean it up. Thanks for reading devs.


Cenora is an Desktop Enviorment made in Scratch. Its for easy use, and good for any old pc that cant even support GNOME, or KDE.

1. How to get it and run it.
   If your device has windows or linux, head to our release page and download the CenoraWIN.zip if you are on Windows and CenoraLIN.zip if you are on Linux.\
   Once you extract it click the cenora file in any file manager you are in, then fullscreen it (optional) if you want it to fully take over as the UI.

2. How to use it.
3. Once opened and done setup you will find an apps button like this
  (apps) now when you click it all of your apps will show in a grid.

3. I'm a developer, how would i make apps for it?
4. Use Scratch as a tool and submit it on our cenorFAQandHelp@gmail.com email. Then we will add it to our marketplace.

5. Thanks for reading and try Cenora!
